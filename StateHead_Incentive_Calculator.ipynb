The class should contain the logic for calculating incentives for each metric and the final incentive. Additionally, create two functions outside the class: one for processing a bulk dataset of State Business Heads and another for processing a single State Business Head's data, both utilizing the `IncentiveCalculator` class. Assume sample values for base payouts, bonus payouts, and portfolio quality adjustment factors based on the provided slabs and buckets."

        "*   An `IncentiveCalculator` class was successfully created to calculate incentives for State Business Heads based on three weighted metrics: Disbursement and AUM Growth (75%), Productivity (25%), and Portfolio Quality (adjustment factor).\n",
        "*   The class includes methods to calculate incentives for Disbursement and AUM Growth and Productivity based on predefined slabs and buckets with assumed payout values.\n",
        "*   A method was implemented to calculate a portfolio quality adjustment factor based on Current % and Early Delinquency % using a predefined matrix with assumed adjustment values.\n",
        "*   The class includes a method to calculate the final incentive by applying the specified weights to the Disbursement/AUM and Productivity incentives and then multiplying by the portfolio quality adjustment factor.\n",
        "*   Two functions were created outside the class: `process_bulk_incentives` for calculating incentives for multiple business heads from a dataset and `process_single_incentive` for calculating the incentive for a single business head, both utilizing the `IncentiveCalculator` class.\n",
        "*   Example usage with sample data demonstrated how to use both bulk and single processing functions, and the code was refined with docstrings and comments for improved clarity and documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current incentive calculation uses hardcoded slabs, buckets, and payout/adjustment values. For a real-world application, these should ideally be configurable or loaded from an external source (e.g., a database or configuration file) to allow for easier updates and flexibility.\n",
        "*   Consider adding error handling within the `IncentiveCalculator` methods and processing functions to gracefully handle cases where input data might be missing or fall outside the defined ranges.\n"
